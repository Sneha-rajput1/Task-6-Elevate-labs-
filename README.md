This repository contains the SQL script and initial data cleaning steps for a **Sales Trend Analysis**, focusing on sales data from the orders table. The goal of the analysis is to calculate and visualize the total monthly revenue and the total number of orders over a specific two-year period: January 2003 through December 2004. The included SQL script aggregates the amount (total revenue) and counts the distinct order_id (total orders) grouped by the month and year of the order_date.

The initial data processing steps, provided in a Python script utilizing the Pandas library, detail the preparation of the raw sales data (presumably from **Superstore_sales_dataset.csv**) before it's loaded for SQL analysis. Key cleaning operations include standardizing column names (stripping whitespace and converting to lowercase/snake_case), converting date columns (order_date and ship_date) to datetime objects, forward-filling missing values in the postal_code column, and removing duplicate rows. The cleaned data is then saved as superstore_sales_cleaned.csv. The included SQL script output demonstrates the monthly breakdown of revenue and order counts for 2003 and 2004, providing the foundation for further trend visualization and business insights.
