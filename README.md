# Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

This project documents the completion of a core data analysis task focused on uncovering monthly sales performance trends. The primary objective was to analyze the retail company's historical data to calculate two critical metrics—**monthly revenue** and **monthly order volume**—over a multi-year period. By using **SQL aggregation techniques**, the project successfully transformed raw transactional data into actionable time-series insights, which is fundamental for identifying seasonality and supporting business forecasting.

The analysis was executed using **MySQL Workbench** against the `sales_data_sample.csv` dataset. The core methodology involved a single, efficient SQL query that utilized the `GROUP BY` clause on the `YEAR_ID` and `MONTH_ID` columns. We calculated the aggregate metrics by applying the `SUM()` function to the `SALES` column for revenue and the `COUNT(DISTINCT)` function to the `ORDERNUMBER` column for unique order volume. Troubleshooting focused on ensuring correct MySQL-specific syntax to successfully process the CSV data and produce the final, sorted result set.

The resulting sales trend report clearly identified significant business patterns. The key finding was the pronounced **seasonal trend** characterized by massive spikes in sales and order volume during **November** of both 2003 and 2004, with revenues consistently exceeding $1 million in that month. This strong insight is immediately valuable for making data-driven decisions related to inventory management, logistics planning, and targeted marketing campaigns for the high-volume holiday season.
